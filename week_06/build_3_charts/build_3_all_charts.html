        <h1> People Killed By US Police in 2015</h1>
        <h2> Deceased Age and Gender Demographics</h2>
        <p>
            I chose to construct a histogram style stacked bar chart to 
            depict the age distribution of the deceased. Due to the nature
            of the data, I chose not to use a histogram because so few of  
            the deceased people were younger than 15 or older than 75.  An 
            interesting detail highlighted by this chart is the number of males and females under the 
            age of 20 who were killed is almost equal which is different from
            all other age groups.  This is an area for deeper investigation.

        <h2>Deceased Race and Potential to Harm Others</h2>
        <p>
            The Race ring chart displays the racial distribution of 
            people killed by police.  I chose a ring chart because this layout
            allows the reader to quickly gain a sense of the percentages of the
            the three races most killed by police.  A reader would be able to
            draw more conclusions if this data was adjusted for the percentage
            of each race in the US population.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The Armed ring chart depicts whether the deceased individual was
            carrying a weapon at the time of their death.  The fact that nearly
            half of the individuals were carrying a gun may indicate that the 
            police officer was acting in self-defense.  However, it's difficult
            to draw conclusions due to the high number of deceased with 
            unreported weapons statuses.

        <h2>Top 3 States For Police Involved Deaths by Month</h2>
        <p>
            California, Texas, and Florida account for more than 35% of all 
            police killings in 2015.  I chose to create a multi-line chart
            to determine if there were seasonal trends across all
            the states or if national events were influencing crime increases
            or decreases.  The depiction indicates no police killing 
            correlation between the states.  While these states had the most
            police killings, they are also the 3 most populous states in
            the country.  It would be interesting to compare police killings 
            per capita for each state.

            These charts are derived from data obtained from the 
            Washington Post and curated by Professor Tiffany France for
            a UChicago MSCAPP Data Visualization assignment.
