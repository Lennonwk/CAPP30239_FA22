        Additional Years Mean Additional Cost
    </p>
    <p>Significant advances in medicine and food production have 
        contributed to more than doubling the world average life 
        expectancy at birth since 1900.<sup>1</sup>  However, 
        the financial burden of supporting senior citizens is an inconvenient 
        consequence of rising life expectancy combined with a 
        falling fertility rate.  Governments must acknowledge 
        current social program cost trajectories and act now to 
        manage citizens’ expectations of unsustainable entitlement 
        benefits.  </p>
    <p>Pension payments and government funded medical cost make 
        senior citizens the most expensive individual demographic 
        for national governments.  As the average life 
        expectancy has increased, the average number of pension 
        payments received over an individual’s lifetime has 
        increased as well.  Additionally, researchers have 
        estimated that 48.1% of an American’s lifetime healthcare 
        cost occur after the age of 64.  During this period of life, 
        Americans are more likely to receive government funded 
        healthcare vice an individually or employer funded 
        insurance policy.<sup>2</sup> The chart below shows that most
        of the largest nations' pension costs have been slowly 
        increasing during the last 30 years.  Researches expect this
        increase to accelerate over the next 30 years as the percentage of 
        retirement age people continues to grow.<sup>3</sup> 
        Elected officials often fail to arrest ballooning cost of senior citizen
        benefits due to fear of jeopardizing their reelection.  Senior citizens tend 
        to have a disproportionate level of political influence due to 
        higher voter participation and campaign contributions 
        when compared to younger voters.

        Doing More With Less
    </p>
    <p>The number of working age relative to retired people in
        developed and developing countries has significantly 
        declined over the last 30 years and the United Nations 
        Population Division expects this trend to continue.  
        The International Monetary Fund assesses that this 
        demographic shift will result in the slowing of gross 
        domestic product (GDP) growth.<sup>4</sup>  “Many empirical studies 
        have found that GDP growth slows roughly one to one with 
        declines in labor force and population growth – a 
        disquieting prospect for both the United States and 
        Europe."<sup>5</sup>   The decreased worker to retiree ratio will 
        result in fewer income tax paying workers per retiree 
        and the reduction in GDP growth will negatively impact 
        corporate tax revenue.  All of these factors will 
        exacerbate the rising pension costs as a percentage of 
        GDP burdens on governments.</p>

        Help Is NOT On the Way
    </p>
    <p>Countries should not expect the increase in 65+ year-olds 
        to be balanced by an increase in young people. Fertility 
        rates during the last 50 years have decreased for every 
        country with Organization for Economic and Development 
        Cooperation (OECD) recorded data.<sup>6</sup>  Researchers correlate 
        the fertility rate decline with women gaining increased 
        access to education, employment opportunities, and 
        contraception.  This increased access is not expected 
        to reverse course at the world level.  The OECD states that a
        population requires a 2.1 fertility rate to remain stable.  The
        chart below shows that nine of the ten largest economies in 
        the world have a fertility rate of less than 2.0.

        What Can Be Done?
    </p>
    <p>
        National governments must act now to set realistic expectations 
        for future retirees.  At the country level, governments that 
        currently have some of the lowest worker to retiree ratios can 
        liberalize immigration policies. However, this is a short-term, 
        acute solution that does not address the long-term global issue. 
        The unpopular solutions may involve raising the eligibility age 
        of pension and social security entitlements or reducing benefits.  
        These reductions in future spending should be paired with 
        incentivizing individual retirement savings accounts or defined 
        contribution plans for workers to build their own financial 
        independence.  These policy changes will be unpopular with 
        workers, but bad news does not get better with time.  
        Necessary policy changes will only grow more drastic as policy 
        makers delay action.   National governments should use Japan as 
        a leading indicator of what’s to come.  “While Japan’s total 
        population is projected to decrease by 11 million, the 
        population age 65 and over is projected to increase by 8 
        million between 2006 and 2030."<sup>7</sup>   Japan has already reached 
        the less than two workers per retiree ratio that is projected for many 
        countries by 2050.  Will Japan prove to be a model to emulate
        or a cautionary tale?

        Process
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal of my project is to inform readers about the effects of the declining birth rate around the world.  Reliable data starting in the mid 1900s and continuing with future projections were available for the United States and some Western European countries.  However, the historical data for many other countries was not available.  To address this limitation, I considered narrowing the focus of my article to only the United States but doing so would ignore countries on more dire financial trajectories along with the interconnectivity of national economies and potential immigration flows.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, I chose to use historical data starting in 1990 and limit countries represented to the ten largest economies to match the countries and dates for all three of my charts.  I accepted that fact that this reduced the significance of my “Government Pension Cost As A Percentage of GDP” chart because most of the countries shown have a small, potentially unremarkable, rise in pension cost over the limited timeframe.  
    </p>
    <p>
        I selected a multi-line chart for the “Government Pension Cost As A Percentage of GDP” visualization because it’s an effective means of showing 26 data points for each of the seven countries and allows the reader to instantly identify trends over time.  I added a tooltip to embolden one selected country at a time to mitigate the confusing effect of numerous lines crossing each other throughout the chart.  
    </p>
    <p>
        I chose to use a grouped bar chart for the “Worker to Retiree Ratio” visualization because it communicates to readers the significant changes in age demographics from 1990 to 2050 projections.  The ability to compare the side-by-side bars is more impactful than a multi-line chart for this data.  
    </p>
    <p>
        I created a world choropleth visualization to color code the fertility rates of all countries but decided not to use it for two reasons.  First, there was a lack of reliable 1990 data for many countries resulting in large sections of my map being filled with grey (Data Unavailable).  Second, the map was interesting for a reader to compare fertility rates around the world, but also became a distraction from the point of the article.  Therefore, I choose to create a simple bar chart that displayed nine of the ten largest economies in the world have fertility rates below 2.1, the rate at which a population will remain stable without accounting for immigration.  
    </p>
    <p>
        I attempted to maintain color, countries, and time periods consistent for all of the visualizations to aid the reader in quickly understanding the charts and compare countries across all three.  
    </p>
    <p>
        I planned to wrap the text around the corresponding chart for each section of the article to allow the reader to quickly reference the chart while reading the text.  However, the “Government Pension Cost As A Percentage of GDP” and “Worker to Retiree Ratio” charts contain a significant amount of information and become difficult to read when reduced in size to appear side by side with text.  Therefore, I decided to use a vertically linear layout of text and charts accepting the limitation that readers will not be able to view more than one chart at a time on their screen.
