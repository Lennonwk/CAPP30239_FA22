### Data source:

### Description of data
> The 2022 Revision of World Population Prospects is the twenty-seventh edition of official United Nations population estimates and projections that have been prepared by the Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat. It presents population estimates from 1950 to the present for 237 countries or areas, underpinned by analyses of historical demographic trends. 

### Why you are interested in this topic
Within this priamary data source, I intend to focus on median population age by country.  I will illustrate median population age data from 1990 and 2020 during which time the median world population aged.  
> While global aging represents a triumph of medical, social, and economic advances over disease, it also presents tremendous challenges. Population aging strains social insurance and pension systems and challenges existing models of social support. It affects economic growth, trade, migration, disease patterns and prevalence, and fundamental assumptions about growing older. - "Why Population Aging Matters A Global Perspective" report produced by the National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and U.S. State Department

### Thoughts on how you would hope to use this data
Intend to generate a world map allowing a reader to quickly compare median ages through around the world.  I will also display the five countries with the largest change in median age 1990-2020 and illustrate greater detail on their population age demographics by decade.
