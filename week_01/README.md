I'm a second year MSCAPP student.  Prior to attending UChicago in Fall of 2021,
I was a US Navy helicopter pilot stationed in Japan.  I'll continue my naval
career after completing the MSCAPP program and intend to use my newly gained
data science knowledge to improve defense procedures and capabilities.
